\section*{Background}

The massive amounts of data generated by biological projects makes the analysis of such projects more and 
more difficult. In such a context, it is important to provide researchers with effective visualization 
tools to explore and extract relevant knowledge from these data sets. Data analysis often leads to the 
production of biological identifiers (gene names, operational taxonomic unit, ...) for which it is 
interesting to know intersections between samples. One of the most popular visualization chart is the 
Venn diagrams \cite{Venn1880} wich allows to identify shared and unshared identifiers providing an insight 
on the similarities between the data sets.

Several Venn diagram applications are availble. Some of them such as BioVenn \cite{Hulsen2008} or venny 
\cite{venny} provides their users a web application with text areas as inputs to enter identifiers.
Where the first one outputs a three lists area-proportional diagram, the second one offers a four lists 
diagram without any respect of area proportions. Canvasxpress \cite{canvasxpress} and the Google Chart API
\cite{googleAPI}, meanwhile, are javascript libraries including Venn diagram features that can easily be 
embedded in any WEB site. These libraries can only have as inputs numbers corresponding to each intersections
and cannot perform any calculations to otain them.

We intruduce jvenn a javascript library aiming to be part of rich WEB environments helping scientists to analyse 
their data, such does already existing tools as jbrowse \cite{Westesson01032013}, Cytoscape-Web \cite{Lopes2010}, 
and jHeatmap \cite{DeuPons2014}. Jvenn handles up to 6 lists venn diagram, can display Edwards-Venn diagram
\cite{Edwards2004}, can easily be embeded within any web site, allows to provide inputs data from three different ways 
(list/number/list+number), provides a feature to export the diagram to png and allows to overload the callback 
function to control users interactions. jvenn has already been used in several scientific publications to display 
sets and their overlapping areas \cite{Bianchia2013, Aravindraja2013}.

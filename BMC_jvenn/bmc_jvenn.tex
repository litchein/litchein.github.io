biologists show differences between gene lists originating from different 
conditions this way. It is also a standard tool to display method comparison results 
in bioinformatics. When the number

\section*{Background}

With the advent of high-throughput biology the number of compared samples,
within an experiment, is increasing. The analysis step often leads to the
production of a biological identifier list, including gene names or operational
taxonomic units, for each sample. Venn diagrams \cite{Venn1880} are a common
visualization chart which allow to spot shared and unshared identifiers
providing an insight on lists similarities. 

In a Venn diagram each list is presented by a transparent shape. Shape overlaps
contain the elements shared between lists or more often the corresponding counts.
In proportional Venn diagrams the size of a shape depends on the number of
elements of the corresponding list intersection. Venn diagrams with up to four 
lists are easy to read and understand, having more lists, they become difficult
to interpret. To solve this problem, the Edwards-Venn \cite{Edwards2004}
representation introduces new shapes providing a clearer view (Fig. 2). 

Many Venn diagram software packages are already available. The first six lines
of Table 1 present a subset of selected packages with their features including 
maximum number of input lists, input data formats, Venn diagram layouts,
application types and output formats. The table gives insight on several aspects
of Venn diagram production and highlights that no WEB applications handle up to
six lists. VENNTURE \cite{Bronwen2012} is the only application able to
produce such diagrams but it only implements Edwards layout and runs only
under MS-Windows producing static MS-PowerPoint and MS-Excel files. Proportional
Venn diagrams can only display very limited number of lists : maximum three.
Therefore programs designed to display high number of lists will implement non
proportional diagrams. 

Hereafter we introduce jvenn, a JavaScript library, developed as a jQuery
plug-in \cite{jquery}, including many features easing diagram production and
enhancing their readability. The library has already been used and cited in two
scientific publications \cite{Bianchia2013, Aravindraja2013}. It is already
embedded in different Web applications such as nG6 \cite{Mariette2012},
RNAbrowse \cite{Mariette} and WallProtDB \cite{SanClemente}.


\section*{Implementation}

\subsection*{Inputs}

The library accepts three different input formats : ``Lists'', ``Intersection
counts'' and ``Count lists''. Examples are presented in Table 1. ``Lists'' contain
for each input a label and an identifier table. ``Intersection counts'' contain a
correspondence table between labels and letters [A..F] and a table linking the
intersection names formed by the successions of letters and the counts. ``Count
lists'' are organized as ``Lists'' in which identifiers are replaced by their
unique occurrences and their counts. With ``Count lists'' the figures presented
in the diagram correspond to the sums of counts of all identifiers shared
between lists. They have been used in diversity studies to present OTU
(Operational Taxonomic Unit) read counts. For ``Lists'' and ``Count lists'',
jvenn computes the intersection counts and displays the chart. For
``intersection counts'', it only displays the graphic.

\subsection*{Display features}

Venn diagrams are commonly used to present up to six lists in its classical 
representation. Reading six lists, the intersection areas are often too small to
display the figures.

To present, in a user-friendly manner, five or six list diagrams, jvenn implements
several features (Fig. 1). First, the display can be switched to
Edwards-Venn (Fig. 2) which gives a clearer graphical representation for six list diagrams. To
enhance the figure's readability on the classical six lists Venn graphic, it was
decided not to present all the values and to link some areas to their figures
using lines. This still did not permit to show all figures, therefore the switch
button panel (Fig. 1) was added. It enables to switch on and off the different lists
and display the corresponding intersection counts. For all diagrams, when the 
intersection count length exceeds the allowed space, the value is substituted by
a question mark. The value pops-up on mouse over. Last, to show the lists taking
part in an intersection, jvenn highlights the corresponding shapes on mouse
over, fading the others out.

The extra charts presented under the Venn diagram simplify verification and
comparison of multiple diagrams. The list size graph allows users to check the
homogeneity of the input list sizes. The intersection size graph can be used to
compare the compactness of multiple Venn diagrams.

Scientists are usually interested in extracting identifier lists for some
intersections, therefore, jvenn implements an one-click function which retrieves
the names of the corresponding sets and the identifiers. To find an identifier
one can use the search box. The shapes containing the matching identifier are
then highlighted.

\subsection*{Outputs}

jvenn display is based on a JavaScript canvas object allowing PNG export. The 
intersection table can also be downloaded as a CSV file. It contains a header 
line with the diagram area labels and, in column, the identifiers of the
elements contained in the area. This feature can be customized by the
developer.

\subsection*{Integration}

jvenn allows programmers, with moderate JavaScript experiences to embed Venn
diagrams in a Web page without dependency. It has been designed following the
examples of jbrowse \cite{Westesson01032013}, Cytoscape-Web \cite{Lopes2010},
and jHeatmap \cite{DeuPons2014}.
The integration documentation is included in the software package which can be
downloaded from http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/jvenn.

\subsection*{Web application}

To simply produce a Venn diagram from identifier lists, jvenn is 
available as a Web application at http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/jvenn/example.html
(Fig. 3).
jvenn's Web application performances depends on the client browser. Using the running version
on a standard Linux computer (one cpu, four GB of RAM), it displays a six lists
diagram of 10 000 identifiers in two seconds.


\section*{Results}

M.A. Dillies and colleagues \cite{Dillies2012} have compared seven RNA-Seq data
normalization methods and given a set of best practices to help biologists in their 
data processing. In table two, they have shown the differences between methods
pair-wise. The raw data table provided by the team contains 5,277 lines and
seven columns. The columns correspond to  the different methods presented in the
'Differential expression analysis' section of the article. The data in the table
was filtered ($p < 0.05$) to produce the method specific gene name lists. Six
out of seven lists were selected for further processing ; Med was left out.
The lists were uploaded to the jvenn application and a Venn diagram was
produced. Using the layout selector the diagram was shown in Edwards Venn
format, in which all figures are accessible. This view presents all the lists
overlap between methods. Considering Fig. 2, the higher values are located in
central areas of the graph showing that the methods share large portions of gene
lists. The list of 484 genes shared by DESeq, TMM, UQ and FQ has been extracted
by clicking on the corresponding figure. Gene G002562 was sought using the
search box. It was found to be part of the five genes shared by FQ and UQ. 

The jvenn statistics show that the different methods produce gene lists with
very different sizes (minimum 417 - maximum 1,249) and that most of the genes are
shared between methods : 1,069 genes out of 1,347 shared by at least four methods.

The same analysis was performed with VENNTURE, the only other tool able to
generate a six list Edwards Venn diagram. First, the software package was
installed on a computer running under MS-Windows. Then, the six gene lists were loaded
in an MS-Excel spreadsheet. VENNTURE was run using the spreadsheet as input
generating a static MS-PowerPoint file containing the diagram and a MS-Excel
file with all the intersection contents. The 484 genes shared by DESeq,
TMM, UQ and FQ  were found in the intersection spreadsheet. The diagram did not
allow to search for gene G002562. It was found using MS-Excel text search in the 
intersection spreadsheet.

\section*{Discussion}

jvenn enables to compare up to six lists and updates the diagram automatically
when modifying the lists content. Compared to VENNTURE it does not need any
installation and gives access to a dynamic diagram providing simple functions to
extract gene lists and perform searches. 
jvenns' statistical charts give a simple and quick overview of the sizes of the
different lists and of their overlaps. It permits to compare different Venn diagrams.
These features are not available in the VENNTURE software package.

For biologists using different techniques in their experiment or in their statistical
analysis, jvenn enables to quickly extract the shared identifiers. Being found 
using different approaches these elements present a higher confidence level.

\section*{Conclusions}

Thanks to its numerous features, dynamic behavior and graphical layout quality, jvenn can be 
efficiently used in many cases to compare different sets of results and easily extract shared 
elements. Being a simple JavaScript plug-in allows to embed it in any Web
environment.

  \caption{\csentence{A six lists classic Venn diagram.}
      This Venn diagram displays overlaps between six different biological
      samples. The icon, located on the top-right, allows users to download the
      diagram as a PNG file. The middle-right switch button
      panel allows to activate or dis-activate lists to access a specific
      intersection count. Charts showing the list size and intersection size 
      repartition located underneath the diagram.}
      \end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{\csentence{A six lists Edwards-Venn diagram.}
      On mouse over a figure, the shape corresponding to the lists involved in
      the intersection are highlighted and the other ones faded out. In
      this example, the user pointed the intersection between samples SRR068049,
      SRR068051 and SRR068052 which contains eight different items.}

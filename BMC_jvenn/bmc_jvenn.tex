\section*{Background}

Biological projects are increasingly multiplexing samples to assess differences between conditions or individuals, 
thus, it is important to provide researchers with effective visualization tools to explore and extract 
relevant differences between these data sets. Data analysis often produces lists of biological identifiers 
(gene names, operational taxonomic unit, ...) which are then compared. List intersection 
results are commonly visualized using Venn diagrams \cite{Venn1880} presenting shared and unshared identifier 
counts, providing an insight on the similarities between the lists.

Venn diagrams are often used to present results in WEB pages. Thus, several Venn diagram applications are 
availble. BioVenn \cite{Hulsen2008} or venny \cite{venny} are WEB applications with identifier input text 
areas. Where the first one offers only a three circles area-proportional diagram, the second one offers a 
four lists diagram without area proportion respect. Canvasxpress \cite{canvasxpress} and the Google Chart 
API \cite{googleAPI}, meanwhile, are javascript libraries including Venn diagram features which can easily 
be embedded in any WEB page. These libraries generate the graphical output given the intersection counts but 
cannot perform the calculations on the lists.

We introduce jvenn, a javascript library helping scientists to present their data, in the same spirit as already 
existing tools such as jbrowse \cite{Westesson01032013}, Cytoscape-Web \cite{Lopes2010}, and jHeatmap \cite{DeuPons2014}. 
jvenn handles up to 6 input lists, can display classical or Edwards-Venn \cite{Edwards2004} diagrams, can easily be 
embeded in a WEB page, allows three different data formats (lists/intersection counts/count lists), exports PNG files and permits 
to overload the callback function in order to control users interactions. jvenn has already been cited in two scientific 
publications \cite{Bianchia2013, Aravindraja2013}.


\section*{Implementation}

jvenn is a javascript library written as a jQuery plugin \cite{jquery}. It can be embeded by referencing the javascript file 
in an HTML page. For researchers who want to produce a Venn diagram from their identifier lists, jvenn is also available as a 
WEB application at http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/index.php?id=116. The installation documentation is included in the software package 
which can be downloaded from https://mulcyber.toulouse.inra.fr/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/venny/index.php/Accueil.

The library provides an option to define the data inputs: \textit{series}. It accepts three different input formats discribed in 
Table 1. In the case of list or count lists \textit{series} it will first execute a function to compute the overlaps between lists and then
display the chart. In the case of intersection counts \textit{series}, the plugin will only display the graphical result. The display 
is based on a javascript canvas object allowing to export the chart as a PNG file. This feature can be disabled by setting the \textit{exporting} 
option to \textit{false} hiding the exporting button.

The WEB application developer can also overload the callback function defining the click on an intersection count. This can be done by defining 
the \textit{fnClickCallback} parameter. The overloading function has access to the \textit{this.listnames} and \textit{this.list} variables 
allowing the developer to control the user interactions. This feature can be disabled by setting the \textit{disableClick} option to \textit{true}. 
To customize the diagram display, the developer can also settle the \textit{colors} option.


\section*{Results and Discussion}

Venn diagrams are commonly used to display list intersections because they are simple to read and understand. This is true up to four lists but 
scientists are interested in using it with more. Nowadays, this type of diagrams is able to present up to six lists in the classical representations.
Reaching this number, the presented diagrams are not proportional with the list counts and the intersection areas are often too small to display the 
figures. 

To present in a user-friendly manner five or six list diagrams, jvenn implements several functionnalities. First, the display can be switched to
Edwards-Venn (Fig. 2) by setting the \textit{displayType} option to \textit{edwards}. It gives a clearer graphical representation for six list
diagrams. To enhance the figures readibility on the classical six lists Venn graphic it was decided not to present all the values and to link some areas
to their figures using lines. This still did not permit to show all figures, therefore a switch button panel (Fig. 1) was added. This panel enables 
to switch on and off the different lists and display the corresponding intersection counts. For all the diagrams, when the intersection count size 
exceeds the allowed space, the value is substituted by a question mark. The real value pops-up on mouse over. This behaviour can be disabled by setting 
the \textit{shortNumber} option to \textit{false}. Last, to show the lists taking part in an intersection, jvenn highlights the corresponding areas on
mouse over the figure and fades the others out.

Scientists are usually interested in extracting identifier lists from some of the intersections, therefore, jvenn implements an on click function which 
retrieves the names of the corresponding samples and the identifiers.

Having an overview of the list size and comparing multiple diagrams can be difficult using a Venn diagram. Thus, jvenn provides two extra charts (Fig. 1) 
bellow the Venn. The first one represents the input lists size histogram. It allows users to check the list size homogeneity. The second one, displays 
the number of elements located in intersections of a certain size. This feature can be used to compare the compactness of multiple Venn diagrams. 
Setting the \textit{displayStat} to true enables this feature.

jvenn performances depends on the client browser. Using the running version (link below) on a standard linux computer, it displays a six lists diagram of 
10 000 identifiers in two seconds.

As examples, we produced two venn diagrams representing six samples SRR068049, SRR06805, SRR068051, SRR068052, SRR068053 and 
SRR068054 corresponding to sets of Operational Taxonomic Units observed under different conditions. Fig. 1 shows intersections
between the six of them using the classical Venn diagram display. In Fig. 2, jvenn overlights the intersection between three samples out of 
six from an Edwards-Venn diagram.


\section*{Conclusions}

jvenn is an easy-to-use library which generates Venn and Edwards-Venn diagrams from lists of identifiers or from
computed intersection counts. Its implementation as a javascript library allows whoever has some WEB programming skills to embed it 
in a WEB page without any dependancies. jvenn is already embeded within nG6 \cite{Mariette2012}, RNAbrowse \cite{Mariette} and 
WallProtDB \cite{SanClemente} WEB applications.

  \caption{\csentence{A six lists classic Venn diagram.}
      This Venn diagram displays overlaps between six different biological samples. When 
      the user clicks on a figure, it calls the developper defined function. 
      The icon located on the top-right, allows users to download the diagram as a PNG 
      file. On the bottom-right of the chart, a switch button panel allowing to activate or 
      disactivate lists to access a specific intersection count. The charts showing the lists 
      size repartition and the number of common and specific elements are located underneath the
      diagram.}

  \caption{\csentence{A six lists Edwards-Venn diagram.}
      On mouse over a figure, the shape corresponding to the list involved in the intersection
      are highlighted and the other ones faded out. In this example, the user points the
      intersection between samples SRR068049, SRR068051 and SRR068052 which contains eight 
      different items.}

\section*{Background}

The massive amounts of data generated by biological projects makes the analysis of such projects more and 
more difficult. In such a context, it is important to provide researchers with effective visualization 
tools to explore and extract relevant knowledge from these data sets. Data analysis often leads to the 
production of biological identifiers (gene names, operational taxonomic unit, ...) for which it is 
interesting to know intersections between samples. One of the most popular visualization chart is the 
Venn diagrams \cite{Venn1880} wich allows to identify shared and unshared identifiers providing an insight 
on the similarities between the data sets.

Several Venn diagram applications are availble. Some of them such as BioVenn \cite{Hulsen2008} or venny 
\cite{venny} provides their users a web application with text areas as inputs to enter identifiers.
Where the first one outputs a three lists area-proportional diagram, the second one offers a four lists 
diagram without any respect of area proportions. Canvasxpress \cite{canvasxpress} and the Google Chart API
\cite{googleAPI}, meanwhile, are javascript libraries including Venn diagram features that can easily be 
embedded in any WEB site. These libraries can only have as inputs numbers corresponding to each intersections
and cannot perform any calculations to otain them.

We intruduce jvenn a javascript library aiming to be part of rich WEB environments helping scientists to analyse 
their data, such does already existing tools as jbrowse \cite{Westesson01032013}, Cytoscape-Web \cite{Lopes2010}, 
and jHeatmap \cite{DeuPons2014}. Jvenn handles up to 6 lists venn diagram, can display Edwards-Venn diagram
\cite{Edwards2004}, can easily be embeded within any web site, allows to provide inputs data in three different formats 
(list/number/list+number), allows to export the diagram to png and permits to overload the callback 
function to control users interactions. jvenn has already been used in several scientific publications to display 
sets and their overlapping areas \cite{Bianchia2013, Aravindraja2013}. 


\section*{Implementation}

jvenn is a javascript library written as a jQuery plugin \cite{jquery} and can be embeded within any WEB applications 
by referencing the javascript file from an HTML page. For researchers who want to produce a Venn diagram from their 
identifiers, jvenn is also available as a WEB application at http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/index.php?id=116. A full 
documentation to insert the plugin within a WEB application is included in the software package that can be downloaded 
from https://mulcyber.toulouse.inra.fr/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/venny/index.php/Accueil.


\section*{Results and Discussion}

The jvenn output is a chart of two to six areas in which each area represents one of the identifiers set define as input. 
The numbers of each overlaps are displayed and are clickable by the user to access the identifiers list belonging to the 
intersection. In order to ease overlaps understanding, when the user is over an intersection number, jvenn overlights the 
pointed classes and blurs the other ones.

The library provides an option to define the data inputs: \textit{series}. The library accepts three different input formats. 
In case the \textit{series} are a list of value, the plugin will compute itself the overlaps between lists. The \textit{series} 
can also define the number to display for each intersections or can be defined as a mix of the first two formats. 
The resulting display is created with the help of the javascript canvas object which allows to export the chart as a png file. 
This last feature can be disabled in order to hide the exporting button from the user by setting the \textit{exporting} option 
to \textit{false}.

jvenn handles up to six classes, what leads to display sixty three overlap numbers. Displaying and interacting with such a chart
can be bulky and difficult. In such a case, jvenn propose a switch button panel which allows to activate or disactivate classes. 
The selected overlap number is then displayed and can be clicked just like the other ones. jvenn also provides the Edwards-Venn
display (Fig. 2) available by setting the \textit{displayType} option to \textit{edwards}. This display gives a different 
graphical representation of the classes which can be clearer whith a 6 classes diagram.
The WEB application creator can also overload the callback function defining the click on an overlap number. This can be done 
by defining the \textit{fnClickCallback} parameter. The overloading function has access to the \textit{this.listnames} and
\textit{this.list} variables allowing the developer to control the users interactions with the jvenn plugin. This feature can
be disabled by setting the \textit{disableClick} option to \textit{true}.

As example, we produced two venn diagrams representing six samples SRR068049, SRR06805, SRR068051, SRR068052, SRR068053 and 
SRR068054 corresponding to sets of Operational Taxonomic Units observed under different conditions. Fig. 1 shows intersections
between five of them using the Venn diagram display. In Fig. 2, jvenn overlights the intersection between three samples of the 
six ones used to create the Edwards-Venn diagram.


\section*{Conclusions}

jvenn is an easy-to-use library aiming to generate Venn and Edwards-Venn diagrams from lists of identifiers or from
computed numbers. Its implementation as a javascript library allows whoever who have WEB programming skills to embed 
it within its WEB application without any dependancies. jvenn is already embeded within nG6 \cite{Mariette2012}, 
RNAbrowse \cite{Mariette} and WallProtDB \cite{SanClemente} WEB applications.

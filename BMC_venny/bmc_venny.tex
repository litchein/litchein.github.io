\parttitle{Background} %if any
In many genomics projects, numerous lists containing biological identifiers are produced. Often 
it is useful to see the overlap between different lists, enabling researchers to quickly observe 
similarities and differences between the data sets they are analyzing. One of the most popular 
methods to visualize the overlap and differences between data sets is the Venn diagram: a diagram 
consisting of two or more circles in which each circle corresponds to a data set, and the overlap 
between the circles corresponds to the overlap between the data sets. Venn diagrams are especially 
useful when they are 'area-proportional' i.e. the sizes of the circles and the overlaps correspond 
to the sizes of the data sets. Currently there are no programs available that can create area-proportional 
Venn diagrams connected to a wide range of biological databases. 

\parttitle{Results} %if any
We designed a web application named BioVenn to summarize the overlap between two or three lists of 
identifiers, using area-proportional Venn diagrams. The user only needs to input these lists of 
identifiers in the textboxes and push the submit button. Parameters like colors and text size can 
be adjusted easily through the web interface. The position of the text can be adjusted by 'drag-and-drop' 
principle. The output Venn diagram can be shown as an SVG or PNG image embedded in the web application, 
or as a standalone SVG or PNG image. The latter option is useful for batch queries. Besides the Venn diagram, 
BioVenn outputs lists of identifiers for each of the resulting subsets. If an identifier is recognized as 
belonging to one of the supported biological databases, the output is linked to that database. Finally, 
BioVenn can map Affymetrix and EntrezGene identifiers to Ensembl genes. 

\parttitle{Conclusions} %if any
BioVenn is an easy-to-use web application to generate area-proportional Venn diagrams from lists of 
biological identifiers. It supports a wide range of identifiers from the most used biological databases 
currently available. Its implementation on the World Wide Web makes it available for use on any computer 
with internet connection, independent of operating system and without the need to install programs locally. 
BioVenn is freely accessible at http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/cdd/biovenn/ webcite.

\section*{Background}
In many genomics projects and other projects handling large amounts of biological data, various lists 
containing biological identifiers are produced, corresponding to e.g. sets of genes regulated under different 
treatments. Often, it is useful to see the overlap between these lists. This enables researchers to quickly 
observe similarities and differences between the data sets they are analyzing. One of the most popular methods 
to visualize the overlap and differences between data sets is the Venn diagram, named by its inventor John Venn 
\cite{Venn1880}. A large number of different types of Venn diagrams exist, the most popular being the three-circle 
Venn diagram, used to visualize the overlap between three data sets. In such a diagram, the size of the circle can 
be used to represent the size of the corresponding data set. This is called an area-proportional Venn diagram 
[2]. Venn diagrams have been used recently to visualize gene lists [3,4]. However, these applications generate 
diagrams with circles of equal size. 

There are some computer programs available that generate area-proportional Venn Diagrams, either as rectangles 
[5] or as polygons [6]. Drawback of these programs is that they need to be downloaded and run locally, limiting 
their use by a wide community. There is also the Google Chart API [7], which can generate circular, area-proportional 
Venn Diagrams, but can only have three numbers as input, and cannot do any calculations to obtain these three numbers. 
There is currently no web application available that can generate circular, area-proportional Venn diagrams connected 
to a wide range of biological databases, and can map different kinds of IDs to genes. In this article, we present a 
web application named BioVenn which can generate circular, area-proportional Venn diagrams just by entering two or 
three lists of biological IDs. IDs that can be recognized by BioVenn as belonging to a certain database, are linked 
to that database. BioVenn currently supports cross-references to Affymetrix [8], COG [9], Ensembl [10], EntrezGene [11], 
Gene Ontology [12], InterPro [13], IPI [14], KEGG Pathway [15], KOG [16], PhyloPat [17] and RefSeq [18]. BioVenn is based 
on a previous version [19], which has been used in several scientific publications to visualize sets and their overlapping 
areas [20-22].
